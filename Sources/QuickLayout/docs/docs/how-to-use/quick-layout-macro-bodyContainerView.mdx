# Custom Content View

By default, QuickLayout adds subviews directly within the view itself.
However, some views may require a different container view for their subviews.
You can override the `bodyContainerView` property to specify an alternative container view.
For example, collection view and table view cells use this to ensure views are added to the `contentView`.

```swift
@QuickLayout
final class ExperimentedView: UIView {

  let contentView = UIView()

  init() {
    super.init(frame: .zero)
    addsSubview(contentView)
  }

  override public var bodyContainerView: UIView {
    contentView /// This will be the container view for the body.
  }

  var body: Layout {
    ...
  }
}
```
